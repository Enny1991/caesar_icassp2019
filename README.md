## Dataset 
The dataset is based on cochlea recordings of TIDIGTS.
Here are the [train](train_set.txt) and [test](test_set.txt) sets sentences that can be used to recreate the dataset 
in the paper. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ugvfnlw90bxftp2/AAAbnJ1GxXXLTsYpGqKwAU_1a?dl=0)

## Code
The code has some useful routines for handling cochlea spikes and calculating priors and features like in the paper.
